# codewars vulns (11 July 2017)
* persistent XSS via clans name in codewars (https://github.com/Codewars/codewars.com/issues/1034)
  * found/reported much earlier (~3 June 2017), but they don't reply to any contact attempts
  * pretty sure it's still vulnerable after "patch". Zero recognition, so I'm not going to bother looking.
* persistent XSS via linkedin profile URL (https://github.com/Codewars/codewars.com/issues/1032)
* persistent XSS via stackoverflow profile URL (https://github.com/Codewars/codewars.com/issues/1033)
